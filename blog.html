                                    Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later,
                                    such as offline data. The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed. It
                                    allows <b>10MB</b> of data to be stored. Local Storage is a new feature introduced
                                    in
                                    HTML5. The data is stored on the browser and system.

                                    Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.
                                    Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login
                                    credentials. The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the
                                    browser is closed. It allows <b>5MB</b> of data to be stored. It's a new feature
                                    introduced
                                    in HTML5. The data is stored on the
                                    browser only.

                                    <b>let</b> & <b>const</b> are also called as block scope that is they are accessible

                                <span><strong><i>Event Loop:</i></strong>
                                    JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language. It means that the
                                    main thread where JavaScript code is run, runs in one line at a time manner and
                                    there is no possibility of running code in parallel. The event loop is a process
                                    that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
                                    Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks
                                    the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call
                                    Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
